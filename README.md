# Sprouts Game
Sprouts Game offers a deceptively simple experience for the average user, masking a complex and intricate set of algorithms beneath its surface. Developed using Python with tkinter as the user interface, the game's true depth lies in the sophistication of its algorithms.

## Gamme rules
This Sprouts game implementation features two distinct modes—standard for strategic play and time-based for added challenge—allowing players to tailor their gaming experience to their preferences.
### Standard game
In two-player game of Sprouts, players commence with a handful of spots, engaging in turns to draw lines between them and introducing new spots along these lines. The gameplay adheres to rules where lines cannot be crossed, new spots emerge at the midpoint of lines, and no spot is permitted to exceed three connections. The ultimate victor is determined by the player who skillfully executes the last move.
### Time-based game
In the time-based mode, the Sprouts game follows the same rules as the standard version, with the key distinction being the inclusion of a limited time for each move; if a player exceeds their allotted time, they lose, and the ultimate winner is the last remaining player.
